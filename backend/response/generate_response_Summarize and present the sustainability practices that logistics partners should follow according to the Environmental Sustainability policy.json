    "natural_language_response": "Based on Dataco Global's Environmental Sustainability policy, logistics partners should follow these key sustainability practices:\n\n1. Annual Carbon Footprint Reporting: All logistics partners are required to provide verified documentation of their carbon footprint on an annual basis. This allows Dataco Global to track and assess the environmental impact of their supply chain.\n\n2. Demonstrate Emission Reductions: Dataco Global gives preference to logistics partners that can show year-over-year reductions in their emissions. This encourages continuous improvement in environmental performance.\n\n3. Adopt Lower-Emission Alternatives: By 2026, at least 50% of all business travel and logistics operations should utilize lower-emission alternatives. This may include using electric vehicles, public transit, or participating in carbon-offset programs.\n\nThese practices align with Dataco Global's overall goal of creating a greener supply chain and reducing their environmental impact. By requiring partners to adhere to these practices, Dataco Global aims to extend its sustainability efforts throughout its logistics network and encourage the adoption of more environmentally friendly practices in the transportation and logistics industry.",
