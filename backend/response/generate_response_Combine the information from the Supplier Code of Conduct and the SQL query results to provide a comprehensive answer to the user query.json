There are no SQL query results provided in the information you shared.\n\nWithout seeing the SQL query results or knowing the specific user query, I cannot generate a complete and accurate response that combines both sources of information. \n\nIf you could provide the SQL query results and the specific user query, I would be happy to help create a comprehensive answer that incorporates both the Supplier Code of Conduct information and the database query results.",
