    "natural_language_response": "Based on the Performance Measurement policy, the key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring supplier performance are:\n\n1. On-time delivery rate: The target for this KPI is 98% or higher. This measures how often suppliers deliver products or services within the agreed-upon timeframe.\n\n2. Quality acceptance rate: The target is set at 95% or higher. This KPI assesses the percentage of supplied goods or services that meet the required quality standards.\n\n3. Customer complaint rate: The maximum acceptable rate is 2% of deliveries per quarter. This measures the frequency of customer complaints related to supplier-provided goods or services.\n\nThese KPIs are evaluated on a quarterly basis. It's important to note that if a supplier fails to meet these benchmarks for two consecutive periods, they will be placed on performance review. Furthermore, they may face suspension from future sourcing opportunities unless they complete corrective action within 60 days.\n\nThese metrics help Dataco Global ensure that their suppliers maintain high standards of performance, contributing to overall business efficiency and customer satisfaction.",
