The information you've shared includes details about the company's inventory policy for \"no-movers,\" but without a specific question from a user, I can't generate a targeted response.\n\nIf you have a particular user query in mind, please provide it, and I'll be happy to combine the policy information with any relevant inventory count data to create a comprehensive answer.\n\nIn the meantime, I can summarize the key points about the company's no-mover policy:\n\n- No-movers are items that haven't been used or issued in the last 12 months.\n- These items are reviewed quarterly.\n- The company considers various disposition methods for no-movers, including discounted sales, liquidation, returns, donations, recycling, or disposal.\n- Keeping no-mover items requires justification.\n- Actions taken on no-mover inventory are reported to senior management quarterly.\n\nIf you have a specific question or additional inventory count information, please provide it, and I'll be able to offer a more tailored response.",
