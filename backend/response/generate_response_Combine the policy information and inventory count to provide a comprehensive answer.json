    "natural_language_response": "Based on the company's inventory policy, \"no-movers\" are defined as items that have not been issued or used within the last 12 months. The policy requires several key actions:\n\n1. Quarterly reviews of no-mover inventory\n2. Flagging of no-mover items for management review\n3. Consideration of various disposition options for no-movers, including:\n   - Deep discount sales\n   - Liquidation\n   - Return to suppliers\n   - Donation\n   - Recycling\n   - Disposal\n\nThe main goals of this policy are to free up warehouse space and reduce holding costs associated with stagnant inventory. If a decision is made to retain any no-mover stock beyond the review period, justification is required.\n\nTo provide a more comprehensive answer, it would be helpful to have the current inventory count, particularly the number of items classified as no-movers. This information would allow for a more detailed analysis of the situation and help determine the potential impact of implementing the no-mover policy. Without this specific inventory data, we can only speak to the policy itself and not its current application to the company's stock.",
