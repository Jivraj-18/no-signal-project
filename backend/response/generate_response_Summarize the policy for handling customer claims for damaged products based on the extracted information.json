However, I can provide a summary of the relevant aspects of Dataco Global's return policy that may apply to damaged items:\n\n1. Dataco Global allows returns within 30 days of delivery, but products showing signs of damage not caused during transit are generally not eligible for return.\n\n2. For defective items, which may include damaged products, Dataco Global provides a pre-paid return shipping label and covers all shipping costs.\n\n3. No restocking fees are applied for defective goods, which could potentially include damaged items.\n\n4. Customers must initiate returns through the company portal or customer service and obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number.\n\n5. Refunds are processed within 5 business days after inspection of the returned item.\n\n6. Exchanges are allowed for defective products within 30 days.\n\nIt's important to note that this information is based on the general returns policy and does not specifically address the process for handling claims for damaged products.
