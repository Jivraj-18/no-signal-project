However, you haven't provided the specific user query or any inventory count data in your message. Without those key pieces of information, I'm not able to generate a complete response.\n\nTo help, I would need:\n1. The exact user query\n2. Inventory count data relevant to the query\n\nOnce I have those, I can combine them with the no-mover policy information you've provided to create a comprehensive answer. \n\nIs there a specific question you'd like me to address, or do you have inventory data you can share? If you provide those details, I'll be happy to formulate a response that incorporates all the relevant information.",
