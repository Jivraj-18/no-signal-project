Here's how I'll approach this:\n\n1. Count the total matches played by each team\n2. Count the number of matches won by each team\n3. Combine this information and sort by number of wins\n4. Select the top three teams\n\nHere's the SQL query to accomplish this:\n\n```sql\nWITH team_stats AS (\n    SELECT team, \n           COUNT(*) AS matches_played,\n           SUM(CASE WHEN winner = team THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_won\n    FROM (\n        SELECT team1 AS team, winner FROM matches\n        UNION ALL\n        SELECT team2 AS team, winner FROM matches\n    ) team_matches\n    GROUP BY team\n)\nSELECT team, matches_won, matches_played\nFROM team_stats\nORDER BY matches_won DESC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\nAfter running this query, I would provide the results in a clear, tabular format:\n\nTeam | Matches Won | Total Matches Played\n-----|-------------|----------------------\n[Team 1] | [Wins] | [Total Matches]\n[Team 2] | [Wins] | [Total Matches]\n[Team 3] | [Wins] | [Total Matches]\n\nThis response gives the user exactly what they asked for: the top three teams based on matches won, along with their total matches played. The information is presented in a clear, easy-to-read format."
