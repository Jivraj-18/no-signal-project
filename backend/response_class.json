The item has had no movement (issuance or usage) for a period of 12 months or more.\n2. These items are flagged for management review during quarterly reviews of slow and no-mover inventory.\n3. No-mover items are considered for disposition through deep discount sales, liquidation, return to suppliers, donation, recycling, or disposal to free up space and reduce holding costs.\n4. Continued retention of no-mover stock beyond the review period requires justification.\n5. Actions taken on no-mover inventory must be reported to senior management in a quarterly summary report."
